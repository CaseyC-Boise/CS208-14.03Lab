      h2 Where It All Began
      p Downtown Donuts opened its doors in 1992 as a small family dream in the heart of downtown. What started as a simple donut shop has grown into a beloved community gathering place where students, workers, and families come together over fresh donuts and coffee.

      h2 Our Commitment
      p For over 30 years, we've remained committed to the same principles that guided us from day one. Every donut is handmade using traditional recipes, prepared fresh each morning before we open. We believe in quality over quantity, and that belief shows in every bite.
